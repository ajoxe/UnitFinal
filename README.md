Welcome to AJ's Final exam!

Steps completed:
All! I finally freaking finished an exam. No android nonsense this time!!!
(Yay for me)

What was easy:
I can make fragments all day! Also making the recycler view was easy.

What was not easy:
Updating the freaking top fragment was hard. I was trying too hard to figure out how to change a fragment thats already in sight. But then I found this neat little trick in the android documentaiton, "find fragment by id" that lets you find an existing fragment instead of making a new one. I then just made an update method in my top fragment that takes a bundle as parameters. It was really nice after that. 

Except this weird thing that happens when i put recycler views in fragments. I have them centered but there always aligned left for a second, lame.

Happy Holidays!!!
